Hi! I am an engineer at Google Cloud in Seattle. I graduated from Georgia Tech with a Masters in Computer Science and a specialization in Machine Learning. Before joining grad school, I was a full-time software developer at Adobe Systems, India. I iteratively document my research and professional work here.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

At Georgia Tech I worked in Prof. Alexey Tumanov's Systems for AI [Lab](https://gatech-sysml.github.io/members/vidushi-vashishta.html) to optimize system's problems in hosting large models in production. I also worked in Prof. Mark Riedl's EI & HCAI [Lab](https://eilab.gatech.edu/mark-riedl.html) to develop co-creative agents for story telling. My interests lie in system's problems in Machine Learning, natural language processing, and efficient backend system development. Happy to chat about common interests, work collaborations, or questions about my work! Can be reached at vvashishth3 at gatech dot edu.
